# Hi, I'm Sergei Tilipin

I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 20 years of experience in core IT infrastructure. I'm also a Windows Subsystem for Linux enthusiast, writing about WSL on my blog [greengorych.io](https://greengorych.io/) and building, testing, and documenting its configurations in the repository [wsl-configs](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configs/).

## What I'm working on

- [greengorych.io](https://greengorych.io/): Writing about automation, infrastructure, and working efficiently with WSL
- [wsl-configs](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configs/): A curated collection of configuration files for Windows Subsystem for Linux
- [makefile-venv-manager](https://github.com/greengorych/makefile-venv-manager/): A Makefile toolkit for managing Python virtual environments
